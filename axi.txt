# cluster 1 
Parameter AWUSER_WIDTH must be greater than or equal to 1.
AWADDR remains stable when AWVALID is asserted and AWREADY is LOW.

# cluster 2 assert property(@(posedge clock) (<signal2> == <value2>) |-> (<signal1> != <value1>));
A value of X on RDATA valid byte lanes is not permitted when RVALID is HIGH.

# cluster 3
when AWVALID is asserted then it remains asserted until AWREADY is HIGH.
# when AWVALID is HIGH and AWCACHE[1] is LOW then AWCACHE[3:2] are also LOW.

# cluster 4
A value of X on AWID is not permitted when AWVALID is HIGH.

# cluster 7
when AWVALID is HIGH and AWCACHE1 is LOW then AWCACHE32 are also LOW.

# cluster 11
CSYSREQ is only permitted to change from HIGH to LOW when CSYSACK is HIGH.
