# SECTION 4.1
AWADDR remains stable when AWVALID is asserted and AWREADY is LOW.

AWLEN remains stable when AWVALID is asserted and AWREADY is LOW.

AWSIZE remains stable when AWVALID is asserted and AWREADY is LOW.

AWBURST remains stable when AWVALID is asserted and AWREADY is LOW.

AWID must remain stable when AWVALID is asserted and AWREADY is LOW.

when AWVALID is HIGH and AWCACHE[1] is LOW then AWCACHE[3:2] are also LOW.

AWVALID is LOW for the first cycle after ARESETn goes HIGH.

when AWVALID is asserted then it remains asserted until AWREADY is HIGH.

# 4-17 examples SECTION 4.2
A value of X on WDATA is not permitted when WVALID is HIGH.
WVALID is LOW for the first cycle after ARESETn goes HIGH.
A value of X on WVALID is not permitted when not in reset.

# SECTION 4.3
A slave must only give a write response after the last write data item is transferred.

All write transaction addresses are matched with a corresponding buffered response.

A value of X on BVALID is not permitted when not in reset.

Recommended that BREADY is asserted within MAXWAITS cycles of BVALID being asserted.

A slave must not give a write response before the write address.
